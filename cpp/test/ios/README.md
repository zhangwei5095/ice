This project builds the iOS C++ Test Suite application for running tests with the iOS simulator or on an iOS device.

You should use the "C++ Test Suite iOS 7" target if you plan to run the tests on an iOS 7.x device, use the
"C++ Test Suite" target otherwise. Bundles are not signed with the iOS 7 target (iOS 7.x doesn't support loading
signed bundles).
